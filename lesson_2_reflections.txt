What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It tells git that this directory is to be tracked....git is created. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	It is an intermediate area. It is different from working directory because it is tracked. But it is different from repository because it has not been committed yet. Arafta yani! 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	check add reset etc

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
	saving different versions of the working program...
	different languages
	paid or unpaid options?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	It helps me follow until the body (or HEAD)

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
	It merges all the commits ie. changes made to them. So that we can follow both of them to the roots.

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
	Automatic is faster. So run auto. And correct manually if there is a conflict error.
