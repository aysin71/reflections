When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When I work with others or use more than one computer to work. Like a Desktop and a laptop.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	I may have some changes not ready to go public yet.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks, I would use on GitHub, especially with repositories I do not have collaborator access to.
	Clones, I would use to copy sth from Github to my computer or duplicate code on my computer
	Branches, Ä± would use to create different versions or try out something new but keep the running (Production) version of the code.
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	So I can go back to it to perge my changes.
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	We would need to do file compares and keep sending the messages back and forth. GitHub is so much easier
